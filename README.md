#This is problem 8 of the IYPT in 2023:



//Take a thick plate of non-magnetic material and fix a neodymium magnet on top of it. 

//Suspend a magnetic rod (which can be assembled from cylindrical neodymium magnets) underneath it. 

//Deflect the rod so that it touches the plate only with the highest edge and release it. 

//Study the motion of such a pendulum under various conditions.


#In these scripts, I derived the equation of motion of the magnetic pendulum through the Lagrange Equation.
#After calculations from scipy, a VPython simulation is attached.
